# Evidence

- [[Data treatment often outsourced to third-world countries]]
- [[A robot collecting the data does not mean the treatment will be automatic]]
- [[Users are more likely to let a robot collect their data than a human]]

# Conclusion

- [[Users are often deluded their raw sensitive data will not be seen by other people]]
