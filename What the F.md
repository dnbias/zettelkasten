- Why do politicians, editors and much of the public care about *words* so much?

  - it's not the concepts (there are synonyms), nor the sounds
  - is profanity *corrupting*, most of all children? Thing is, to moralists in this matter, this property of this particular type of language is self-evident - there are no justifications other than that
  - the answer from progressive writers:
    - *true moralists should hold that violence and inequality are **obscene**, not sex and excretion.*
  - still, in the progressive sphere have been introduced linguistic taboos of their own - such as the N-word
    - BUT, these words are part of fights for social equality and rights. They have a **political value** behind them not just a preoccupation for "decency"

- it seems *bad language* is a relative conception

- **emotional power of swearing**

  - curses provoke a different response that their synonyms because *connotations* and *denotations* are stored in different parts of the brain - related: **System 1** and **System 2** in [[Thinking Fast and Slow]]
  - limbic system - ancient network regulating motivation, emotion
    - likely suspect is the amygdala - it lights up when a human is shown angry faces and taboo words
  - neocortex - region highly developed in humans seat of perception, knowledge, reason, planning
  - likely: denotations in neocortex left cortex - connotations in neocortex right hemisphere and limbic system

- [[Stroop effect]] - automatic nature of speech perception forces us to consider the unpleasant connotations of words against our wil

- **historical root of swearing** in English and other languages

  - religion - *profanity* is that which is not sacred

> Blasphemy itself could not survive religion; if anyone doubts that, let him try to blaspheme Odin. [[$cit]] [[G.C.Chesterton]]

- oaths were the way people submitted a contingency to have others believe promises otherwise vain
  - religion had this function, now social and legal contracts have it
  - is US courts witnesses still have to swear on the Bible
  - although the emotional power of religion dimmed the underlying psychology is still there
- *fucking* and derivatives are words trying to evoke the idea of exploitative sex on someone, so its not simply sex being demonized - its implying a power dynamic

> You taught me language, and my profic on't is, I know how to curse. - Shakespeare's Caliban [[$cit]]
