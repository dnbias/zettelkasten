# The Good

- context throught side by side content: [[Marginalia]]
  - always been the power of the written word
- here comes the Intenet with bidirectional links
  - closer to out brain convolutedness

# The Less Good

- link are distracting
  - a flood of links is cumbersome on the eyes
  - but they are *great* for note-taking and expanding on ideas
  - for someone tryng to follow a logical thread the links get confusing quickly
    - <u>links are rabbitholes</u> the reader might never emerge from
- [[Project Xanadu]] is cool and all but results in pretty but confusing lines[^1]

# Dilution of Meaning

- links water down meaning
  - in linking you are hiding behind someone else'sh writing[^2]

[^1]: right but hypertext is a great tool, it has to be used with purpose

[^2]: *write better*, if you can't then link somewhere
