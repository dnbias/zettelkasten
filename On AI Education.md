# Notes

> What just happened in AI and how it is being misunderstood

- two main ways to tackle a problem
  - **model-based**
    - represent and reason
    - using logic and probability
  - **function-based**
    - *fit function to data*
      - just give me data, make a **blackbox**
      - no need to understand exactly what's going on under the hood
    - using [[Neural Network]]
    - taught in the classrooms
    - good for tasks usually associated with perception or cognition
- eras of AI
  - knowldge representation and reasoning
    - very `CS` based
  - machine learning
    - very Statistics and Optimization based
  - neural networks
    - mostly Engineering based
- as we are moving forward the background of researchers are being diluted
- now the tech is being deployed and it's hitting walls
  - there is need of logic skills in the next generation of AI research
  - **solid computer science education is needed**
