- technology hype often leads to unreasonable expectation

  - [[hype]] relies on a selective amnesia for the unfulfilled promised of the past, that way enthusiasm is replenished
    - \[[Seletive Amnesia]]: how does it relate to the [[Mandela Effect]]? Is it the opposite?\]

- with the [[Blue Brain Project]] things weren't going as planned, then a bigger endevour was necessary: [[Human Brain Project]], funded with a billion Euros by the EU

  - controversy, open letter by 800 neuroscientists disagreeing with [[Henry Markram]]

- seeing simulated neural activity: how do you know whether the activity was right or wrong?

  - how can a perfectly fixed array of signals simulate the impredictability of biology?
    - bugs are quickly fixed while neurons don't always have perfectly fixed action potential, cells mutate and change impredictably

- Computational Neuroscience is gradually leaving behind biological brains in search of perfect algorithms
