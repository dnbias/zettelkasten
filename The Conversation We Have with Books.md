# Notes

- the conversation with books happens in different steps and at different times
  - note taking[^1]
    - summarizing
    - outlining
    - rewriting in your own words
  - revisiting the notes[^2]
  - reading other work of the same author
  - reading on the same argument from different sources
  - rereading your notes on the subject in different times

[^1]: To really digest a work of literature the output you put out from a book must be comparable to the input you are exposed to.

[^2]: Otherwise the knowledge from the book will be lost to memory.
