title: What is This?
---

This is a [[Zettelkasten]] and what is also known on the web as a [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). The work that inspired me to publish this is [[Work with the garage door up]] and the [[Learn In Public]] movement. I think that having my working notes public for all to see creates a good kind of peer pressure, the kind that gets things done, possibly.

All the content is `WIP` and in a mix of languages, mainly italian and english. Sometimes I switch in between sentences. Scusate.

The website is based off the blueprint of [[Jethro Kuan]]'s own [braindump](https://braindump.jethro.dev/). Everything is done in [[Emacs]] ([[org-mode]] + [[org-roam]] â™¡), converted to markdown compatible with [[Hugo]] and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). If you're curious look at my [github](https://github.com/dnbias/braindump).
