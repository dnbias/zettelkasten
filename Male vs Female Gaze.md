- media often cater toward a specific sex

  - this means the characters are portrait in very different ways
  - different characteristics

- the difference in promisquity can be observed from a social level and from the nature realm

- [[David Buss]]

  - evolutionary psychologist have a theory about these differences in Female and Male
  - traits good for the survival of the species ([[Natural Selection]]) will be most common in individuals
    - so male promiscuity and female pickiness should be traits developed to ease propagation of genes

- many speculate the number of *gametes* of the sex to be a deciding factor in the difference in behavior and promiscuity

  - average male: 525 Bilion sperms
  - average female: 300 Thousand eggs by puberty

- [[Stereotypes]], what do them stem from?

  - *men = pigs*
    - *attractiveness*
      - in the evolutionary theory: used as an indicator of health and fecundity
    - stereotypical female in media:
      - attractive
      - not like other girls
      - "sex symbols"
  - *women = gold diggers*
    - status
      - *paternal investment*, higher in females just through gestation
      - lower testosterone in males in a relationship
        - most useful indicator of nurturing behavior
    - attractive/heathy less important
      - higher testosterone, higher
    - stereotypical archetype
      - good looks
      - sweet side
      - nurtiring and protective
    - Bieber study
      - the lyrics in the early albums:
        - sensitive
        - resourcefull
        - *sweet boy*
      - the lyrics in the later albums:
        - not cheesy anymore
        - more allusion to sex and drugs
          - in line with its demografic
  - many new web-stars in [[TikTok]] and other [[Social Media]] reach fame by following the male / female archetype

- BUT

  - everybody values positive characteristic
    - these are necessities, but to different degrees to different people
  - stereotypes cater to a younger demografic, more prone to idealize the opposite sex and unknown experiences
    - experience in the real world changes the point of view
