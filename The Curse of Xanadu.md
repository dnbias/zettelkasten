# Notes

- [[Ted Nelson]] "king of unsuccessful software development"
- the goal of the project was to put all information within reach of all
  - eliminate scientific ignorance
  - create a formula for discussion and debate
- Ted suffers from [[Attention Deficit Disorder]][^1]

[^1]: All the recording, audio or otherwise, Nelson does is to combat the fleetability of his thoughts.
