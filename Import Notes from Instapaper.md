# Instapaper

- read it later service
- can send articles to Kindle
  - \[what about *not* Kindle dammit\]

Adrian doesn't feel like it's worth the pain sending articles to [[Instapaper]] to read them later. He feels it's more exiting to read them on site, when he finds them.

- scraping the articles off markdown files to search for free and fast
  - never run the risk of losing the source

Interesting idea, maybe too much of a pain. Also intense on the memory? It's getting cheaper and cheaper i guess.
