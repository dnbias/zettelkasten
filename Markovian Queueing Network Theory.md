title: Markovian Queueing Network Theory
---

Theory of queueing networks based on these assumptions:

- system modeled by a *stationary stochastic model*
- jobs *stochastically independent*
- jobs steps from device to device follow a [[Markov Chain]]
- system in *stochastic equilibrium*
- service time requirements for each device comform to a *exponential distribution*
- system is *ergotic*[^1]

[^1]: long-term time averages converge to the values computed for stochastic equilibrium
