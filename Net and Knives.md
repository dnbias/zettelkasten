Found in [an article](https://mentalpivot.com/nets-and-knives-the-interplay-between-expansive-and-atomic-notes/) by [[Mental Pivot]]: atomic notes ([[$zettel]]) are the core of the [[Zettelkasten]] method but more general, outline and summary type notes have their usefulness. These notes are like casting a *wide net* gathering the interesting concepts in the source material. These concepts if important enough to the Knowledge Base make it to atomic notes, knives.
