# Notes

- photos of people leaked
  - various states of undress
  - underage children
  - uncensored faces
- leaked by third party contract workers for data labeling
  - violation that is bound to happen when independent workers try to collaborate on the web to raise productivity
- corporation says the robot owners signed the *terms of service*
  - of course these terms are vague on all the steps of data treatment
  - users should not only be able to read the terms but *understand them*
    - the complications of privacy are not easily understood by most people
  - weird phrasing and distinctions (no data selling $`\neq`$ no data sharing)
- corporations have the data treated by third parties to raise productivity
  - third party is not easily controlled
  - internal data treatment can be protected and controlled through `NDAs` and corporation policy
    - would be the most privacy-safe procedure
- hacker found functionalities to *upload* data even in products of which terms of service only defined data treatment as local
  - should the corporation be blindly trusted?
- corporations argue that facial data is necessary to develop AI tools to then automatically censor them in future data collection
  - facial data may not be strictly needed
  - silhouette data may be all that's needed
  - synthetic data should be the norm, not user data
- users are much more likely to accept data collection if a cute little robot is what's collecting and treating the data, in reality the data gets treated by humans in third world countries often
