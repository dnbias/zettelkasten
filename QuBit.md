> A `qubit` is a vector of two complex numbers with unit length.

- a qubit, unlike a bit that is either 1 or 0, is inherently probabilistic
  - 2 identical qubits may have different values once measured
- a qubit once measured loses its quantum properties collapsing to one of two measurable states

> The combined state of multiple qubits is the tensor product of all the qubits.
