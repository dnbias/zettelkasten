> Created by Joseph Weizenbaum at the MIT Computerized Reasoning Laboratory in 1964 – 1966, the ELIZA chatbot was not only the first chatbot, she is still one of the most popular chatbots to have ever been created. ELIZA used a number of different programs or “scripts” to help manage her interactions with users.
