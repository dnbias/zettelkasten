title: Layouts
---

Optimization and insanity begin here.

- `querty`, good ol' shit
- `dvorak`
  - nice alternating movement
  - layout works well in non-english
  - not `querty` based
- `colemak`
  - <https://dreymar.colemak.org/>
  - optimized for adjacent finger movement
- `workman`
- `hands down`
- `mtgap`

Then with a given layout and [[QMK]] or alternatives:

- home row mods
- callum style layers: <https://blog.ffff.lt/posts/callum-layers/>
- for non-english typing [compose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key) seems to be the best solution
