# Notes

- Wu draws inspiration for the thesis of the book from the concepts of [[Creative Destruction]] and the studies of [[Joseph Schumpeter]]
  - this concept describes the way that industrial innovation in a capitalist systems tends to completely replace the previous status quo, in cycles of industrial growth
  - Wu argues that this dynamic gets arrested by monopolists that have the economic and political power to stop the competition from even having the possibility of innovating in this way
    - often controlling research and patents in their own labs and deciding when it is time to release innovation
- [[Kronos effect]]
  - companies *eating* their prole to stop the innovation from hurting their business
- power struggle and humanity crave for imperial control
  - Wu argues that the constitution did a good job in the last centuries in controlling this tendency in politics
  - this in the US got translated to free market capitalism with great power being detained by single entities or capitalists with monopolies
- the main argument of the book is that the information market different from others is being more susceptible to monopoly control in what Wu calls [[The Cycle]]
- [[The Cycle]]
  - all modern communications technology lived through it
    - telephone, radio, cinema, TV
  - the first years of the technology come with optimistic hopes for its effect on the human condition, great optimism and idealism over the **open** medium
  - the openness doesn' t last
    - big players argue that a single corporation can offer a much better product with a monopoly
      - this comes with great control over what can get communicated over the medium
  - *from somebody's hobby to somebody's industry*
  - *from freely accessible lane to one strictly controlled by a single corporation or cartel*
  - *from open to closed system*
  - does this apply to the web? nobody knows yet
    - modern-day risks can be found in the attempts at *vertical integration* that for example Apple has been planning
- great personalities Wu uses to construct his claim
  - Theodore Vail with `AT&T` in long distance communications
  - David Sarnoff with `RCA` and `NBC` in radio
  - Adolph Zukor with Paramount and its control over distribution outlets
- [[Common Carrier]]
  - there are businesses so important to the correct functioning of our government and everyday life that must be free of bias and discrimination in their activity
  - concept that Wu adapts to the information and communication industry with what he defines as [[Net Neutrality]]
