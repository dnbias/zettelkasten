title: Playing the Zettelkasten RPG

> Here it is interesting the taxonomy the author uses to structure it's `zk`. Could be used by implementing tags for the various layers, which I guess is much more flexible than the method he uses (i.e. prefixes in the titles). This I already did do intuitivly but this system he created is much more nuanced.

# Notes

## Rougue-like

- does the `zk` produce writing?
- maybe it's better to think it as a writing partner
- it's tempting to try an compose a piece just by assemblying notes
  - don't overthink or overengineer the `zk`, it's counter productive
- author draws a comparison between the `zk` system and a `rpg` game in the vein of the rougue-likes
  - failing is part of the progression

## Constraints

- they are good to visualize the progress in the `zk`
- break down the ambiguous synthesis of content to small steps
- give way to creativity
- forward momentum
- creating a game

*All these are pretty vague*

- a constrait can limit the amount of choices[^1]
- a notebok in this sense offers natural constraints whereas a wordprocessor doesn't, you can do the hell you want
  - advice: **do not edit while writing**
  - in a digital space we as users have to choose our constraints

## Notes Structure

*the author uses greek letters for identifying the various classes, I think it's probably smarter to have tags for that*

- **base note**
  - a belief
  - a relationship
  - affirming or countering an idea
- **problem note**
  - from 3 related notes
- **series note**
  - frame 3 related problem
- **fragment note**
  - 2 series notes
  - this is where more broad notes are placed
- **concept note**
  - usually linked to **hypothesis** or **thesis**
